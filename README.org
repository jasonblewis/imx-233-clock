* About
  This is a project to make an clock out of 7 segment
  displays directly connected to the GPIO ports of the [[https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/iMX233/iMX233-OLinuXino-MINI-WiFi/][iMX233 OLinuXino
Mini Wifi]].
* Which Distro to use?
  I tried numerous prebuilt images for this device before finding a
  stable and up to date one. As of the writing of this, the most up to
  date image seems to be the [[http://archlinuxarm.org/][archlinux-arm]] one. It is up to date and
  as far as I can tell all the patches for the OLinuXino are already
  applied. Download it from [[http://archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-olinuxino-latest.img.gz][here]].
